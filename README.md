</br>



👩‍💻🕵️ My professional experience has been in research and development because I feel accomplished in contributing to the solution of society's problems and in the generation of knowledge, applied in the development of new products and processes, as well as improving the existing ones.

   I believe that research 🕵️ related to mathematical modeling and numerical simulation is a way to apply my scientific knowledge related to chemical engineering in solving different real problems. This is an opportunity that can have an impact from the industry to the final consumer.

   I believe in collaborative 👯 research and development between companies, research institutes and universities. Also, I believe in interdisciplinary teamwork to solve the target problems in research projects.

📚👩‍💻 I am fascinated by the field of data science. The ability to extract, explore, analyze and the possibility of developing knowledge, as well as the application in different fields to propose strategies and appropriate tools for solving real problems. Consequently, I believe that processes when combined with data science contribute to the improvement of projects, processes, products and services.



#### ◽️ In addition, I have great interest in applying my knowledge in engineering to contribute to the development and innovation of processes and products!
